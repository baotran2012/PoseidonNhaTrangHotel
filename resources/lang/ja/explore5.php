    <p>The city of Nha Trang is known for its beaches, however this seaside tourist town of Vietnam has a few very nice interest points, such as for example the&nbsp;Cathedral of Nha Trang, located on a small hill 1 kilometer away from the beach. The Nha Trang Cathedral is the largest church in the city of Nha Trang, built by the French in the&nbsp;year 1933&nbsp;and entirely performed in commented, is&nbsp;located on a small hill&nbsp;of just about 10 meters in height, enough to maximize the impressive construction dating back to&nbsp;the year 1933</p>',
