    <p>Boulders are stacked on top of one another at this site drenched in legend 3.5km from the city centre. The large boulder at the tip of the promontory is said to bear the hand-print of a fisher giant who fell from the cliff when the fairy he was spying on saw him. It is a good spot to come at sunset.</p>',
